### Simple Node.js from *node* built over a openssh-server

This image was built on top of lrgc01/ssh-stretch_slim, or debian:stretch-slim plus an openssh-server.

The goal is to create an sshd server with Node.js commands to be used by another server from the same container set like Jenkins service from a docker-compose, for example.
