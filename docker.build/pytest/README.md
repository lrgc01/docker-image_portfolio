### pytest and pyinstaller on python3-pip

Simple image from debian:stretch-slim added with python3-pip and then pip install pytest pyinstaller.

The goal is to create an sshd server with these commands to be used by another server from the same container set like Jenkins service from a docker-compose, for example.
